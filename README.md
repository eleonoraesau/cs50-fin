<h2>Description:<h2>
<p>My name is Eleonora Esau and I have completed a coding bootcamp prior to taking the CS50x course.
We learnt Ruby on Rails and some JavaScript, which this website is also built with.

This website contains a couple multiple choice questions, to test your trivial knowledge.

Solve them all to see your score! <br>
(the name of the website is a random synonym of the game 'trivial persuit')<p>
